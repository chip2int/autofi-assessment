## Car Inventory

This project attempts to upload a CSV file containing car inventory to a server. This information is then saved in a in-memory Sqlite DB after extracting only the required columns from the CSV file. The required columns are controlled through a config file.

Use `npm run start` to star the server and upload a file using Postman or curl.
